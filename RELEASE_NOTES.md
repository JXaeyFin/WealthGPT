# AlloLabs v1.2.0

AlloLabs v1.2.0 completes the platform's rebrand and introduces a
Bloomberg-terminal-inspired web interface for
configuring, running, and reviewing the portfolio research pipeline.

## Highlights

- Complete product, module, launcher, environment-variable, report, and
  artifact rebrand to AlloLabs while retaining the established logo artwork.
- Unified Run Console with dynamic optimizer, training, out-of-sample, AI
  provider, model, regularization, position-cap, and sector-cap controls.
- Live terminal relay with configuration-aware progress estimation.
- Maximum-Sharpe and minimum-volatility portfolio dashboards with sector
  exposure, performance metrics, and clickable holding details.
- Company detail panels with fundamental ratios, linked news headlines, and
  285 locally bundled company logos.
- OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini research support with an optional
  configurable global AI audit stage.
- Model guide with provider-key detection, model strengths, limitations, and
  published context-window information.
- Integrated PDF report viewer, performance chart, example results, and
  preloaded AI research views.
- Improved optimizer stability, long-only and bounded long/short handling,
  soft regularization, hard limits, metadata resolution, and report generation.
- Paginated allocation appendix with readable fixed row spacing and coverage
  down to 0.005% absolute portfolio weight.
- Refined holding-rationale pages with locally bundled rounded-square company
  marks and graceful fallback when a logo is unavailable.

## Distribution Notes

- No API credentials are included.
- Company logos are served locally; Logo.dev is not contacted during dashboard
  use.
- Generated live portfolios, research caches, reports, and local archives are
  excluded from the release.
- Sanitized examples remain bundled so the dashboard is populated before the
  first run.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- At least one supported AI-provider API key only when generating new AI views
